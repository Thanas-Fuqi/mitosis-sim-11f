# Mitosis Simulation

## Website [mitosis-sim](https://thanas-fuqi.github.io/mitosis-sim-11f/).

## Purpose
This website is designed to support two main groups:
- **Students**: Provides an interactive, non-traditional learning experience, catering to diverse learners seeking innovative educational approaches.
- **Teachers**: Offers a visualization tool for teaching, enhancing the effectiveness of educational content compared to traditional hand-drawn methods.

## Features
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, JS, CSS with a focus on P5.js for creating interactive simulations.
- **Complex Layout and Logic**: 
  - The website utilizes a chaotic system via Perlin Noise to simulate organic movement, one of the most challenging aspects of coding organic matter.
  - Encapsulation and inheritance are used to manage object-specific functions and ensure smooth transitions between different cell states during mitosis.

## How to Use
1. Visit [mitosis-sim](https://thanas-fuqi.github.io/mitosis-sim-11f/).
2. (Optional) Read the introduction text.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
4. `For mobile users`, enable desktop view in Google Chrome.
5. Wait for the cells to appear on the screen.
6. Click on the cells to see them divide into two.
7. Use the sliders to adjust speed, number, and size of cells and division.

**Note**: The simulation is memory-intensive; excessive cell division may slow down or crash your browser.
